# ENSAE - 2A - Linear Time Series
A project of linear time series analysis done in collaboration with Jeanne Gauthier. The main goal of this project is to study an Industrial Production Index given
by the INSEE.

Let X be this IPI. We first compute Z_t = log(X_t) then train many ARMIA(p, 1, q) to choose the best. We also base our analysis on ACF and PACF plot.
